### Highlights in DroneGait Dataset

**(1) Extensive Range of Vertical Views**

DroneGait offers a unique perspective by including gait sequences captured at different vertical angles, ranging from approximately 0 degrees to 80 degrees.

**(2) Large and Varied Collection of Sequences**

The DroneGait dataset contains a considerable number of sequences, with over 22,000 instances featuring 96 different subjects. This quantity and diversity of data support the dataset's effectiveness for training and evaluating gait recognition models.

 **(3) Incorporation of Real-Life Variability**

The DroneGait dataset is designed to mimic real-world conditions by including sequences that capture subjects under various walking scenarios. It encompasses not only normal walking patterns but also introduces factors such as walking with bags (BG) and walking in different clothing (CL).
